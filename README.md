### Alexa Youtube Music Skill

Alexa does not provide native integration to neither youtube nor youtube music. This skill helps to play music from
youtube on your amazon echo device.

NOTE: The skill will not be published for public use as it can incur charges due to AWS Lambda usage.  Users who
are looking to install this skill on their echo device should have AWS developer account and then use the skill

Anyone is free to publish the skill in their AWS account so that non-tech savvy users can also make use of it. If doing
so make sure that the invocation name is changed from _youtube_ as brand names are not allowed in published skills.

If there are any already publicly available skills that plays youtube music, please feel free to add it here:

NOTE: Work is under progress for directly using youtube music instead of youtube.
